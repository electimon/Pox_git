Pox_git (Puppylinux_Olpc_Xo_git), is a collection of scripts and files needed to 
build Puppy linux for the OLPC XO-1 and XO-1.5 laptops, starting from a 
puppy ISO image and public sources

There are 4 build scripts and several modified puppy-scripts.
  
`XOpup_kernel_builder.sh' will build the XO-specific kernels from the 
olpc-2.6 and Aufs2.2 gits, with patched puppy-specific config files.
 
`build_from_OLPC_git.sh' will download sources from the OLPC git patch them
as needed and make the files relating to the XO power management, fetch the 
wireless firmware from recent OLPC builds and download and compile the XO-1.5
chrome video driver.

`create_xo_puppy.sh' will use the kernel and sfs sources to modify a puppy 
ISO image and make the XO-compatible files, transfer them in a USB/SDcard
and make it ready to boot the XO-1 and/or XO-1.5
The associated `pkgs_remrc' files has the instructions for the files and 
packages that will be either totally removed or moved from the main sfs 
to an `extras.sfs'. It can be edited as needed.

`make_build' is the master script that calls the other 3 but the previous
scripts can run also independent of each other, to make a kernel  or repackage
a build, for example.

The files in XO/XO_sfs folder are either modified puppy scripts or new ones 
appropriate for OLPC's XOs needed to suit XOs special characteristics.

The XO/extra_pets folder can be used to included additional pets in 
the build. Just add them in the folder 

The build scripts can run in any linux distro to build an XO-puppy, however 
is highly suggested to use either the puppy version you want to build for 
the XOs or a binary-compatible distro as building environment. On another 
distro you may need to run as root to mount the sfs or run mksquashfs.

It is suggested to use a recent puppy build as base, as older ones may not
have the geode driver and fail to compile the chrome driver.
It is also advised to add the full udev-151+ package from a compatible 
distro in the build to get full power management and keyboard functionality.

We welcome patches and addition that will suit the XOs, either in the scripts 
or the XO/XO_sfs/* files.
